# BackupPC-v3-BetterCSS
A more modern CSS for BackupPC v3, heavily inspired by INSPINIA Bootstrap Theme. Works best with BackupPC set to English or German. If you use another language be sure to edit the input[value=] selectors to your language.

Tested with Chrome 60 & Firefox 55

I learned CSS in early 2000s when I was still a kid and only used it rarely since, so don't expect nice/clean CSS code. In addition, BackupPC v3's HTML/CSS is very topsy-turvy itself so it's hard to get a consistent look all around.
