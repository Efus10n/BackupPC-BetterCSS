# BackupPC-v3-BetterCSS
A more modern CSS for BackupPC v3, heavily inspired by INSPINIA Bootstrap Theme.

Works best with BackupPC set to English or German. If you use another language be sure to edit the input[value=] selectors to your language.

I'm not a CSS master. I learned it when I was still a kid in early 2000s and use it rarely, so don't expect nice/clean CSS code. In addition BackupPC v3's HTML/CSS is very topsy-turvy itself so it's hard to get a consistent look all around.
